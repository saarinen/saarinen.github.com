<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">“Who presents this woman for marriage to this man?”</span></div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Thank you all for coming to witness the union of Nick and Nikki.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I am honored and humbled to be in this position with you two today.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Nick has been my best friend since we were both 12 years old, or said another way, 4 years before nick stood 5 ‘ tall.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Nikki I have known since Nick started talking about her, which couldn’t have been more than 2 days after he had laid eyes on her.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Unfortunately I didn’t have the pleasure of actually meeting her until a sunny evening at Safeco field.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">As eloquent as Nick is, his descriptions barely did her justice.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">In case there are some here who don’t know the story, Nick and Nikki met  through eHarmony where they both marked “11” on the question “How important is physical attraction to you?  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">In actuality, Nick met Nikki through a company they both worked at.  Nick observed Nikki from afar until the opportunity presented itself, and as fearless as Nick is, he took it.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">And now here we stand, testament to the amazing results a moment of bravery can produce.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Before we get started, I want to take a moment. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">For the past several months, your lives have been a whirlwind of planning, preparation, worrying and waiting, not to mention your normal life responsibilities which haven’t exactly been trivial.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">The last few days have probably been the most busy.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">You may be standing here now, thinking about what may have not gone exactly to plan, how the rest of the evening is going to go, whether or not Joe got you that toaster you registered for, or trying to decide if your officiant is a moron.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Let all those thoughts drift away.  Enjoy this experience.   If I may quote Capt. Agustus McRae:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<span style="font-size: 24px;">“Lorie darlin', life in San Francisco, you see, is still just life. If you want any one thing too badly, it's likely to turn out to be a disappointment. The only healthy way to live life is to learn to like all the little everyday things, like a sip of good whiskey in the evening, a soft bed, a glass of buttermilk, or a feisty gentleman like myself.” <br/></span>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">In preperation for this ceremony, I had written a whole dissertation about marriage, it’s history, what it means to me, and things I’ve learned. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"> I came to the realization that along with being, boring, and somewhat preachy, it wasn’t right for me to try and define the parameters of your marriage.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Looking around this room, I see many strong marriages and excellent role models.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">However, at the very core, those who have taken the oaths that you two are about to take, have felt many of the feelings, shared the same hope, and tackled the same fears that you have faced, and have thus far stayed out of jail… barely, don't have all the answers for the challenges that you will face together. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Take advantage of the amazing support structure that you have, but don’t allow the success of your marriage to be defined by another’s.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Success can be only realized in each others eyes.  </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Given that, I threw away the dissertation and condensed it to these hopes I have for you:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">to find joy in each others company…</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">to face your lives as partners…</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">to be open and honest with each other, forsaking all others...</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">to build a happy, safe, and inviting home…</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">and to accept the love <span style="-evernote-last-insertion-point:true;"/>of your friends and family who are here to support your new partnership, and return it in kind.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">This ceremony is not what binds you together for the future. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">The decisions each of you make, and the continuing conscious choice to meet the challenges of life as partners are what will ultimately strengthen your bond and your home. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">As an expression of your total willingness to commit yourself to one another, I invite you to face each other and join hands.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Nick, do you come before this gathering to proclaim your love and devotion for Nikki? Do you promise to support her, respect her, and care for her during times of joy and hardship? Do you pledge to remain faithful to her?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     Groom Responds: I do.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Nikki, do you come before this gathering to proclaim your love and devotion for Nick? Do you promise to support him, respect him, and care for him during times of joy and hardship? Do you pledge to remain faithful to him?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     Bride responds: I do.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     To Nick: Repeat after me:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I promise to give you the best of myself and to ask of you no more than you can give.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I promise to accept you the way you are.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I fell in love with you for the qualities, abilities, and outlook on life that you have - and won't try to reshape you in a different image.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I promise to respect you as a person - with your own interests, desires, and needs,  - and to realize that those are sometimes different, but no less important than my own.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">And finally, I promise to love you in good times and in bad,  - with all I have to give and all I feel inside  - in the only way I know how…completely and forever.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     To Nikki: Please repeat after me:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I promise to give you the best of myself and to ask of you no more than you can give.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I promise to accept you the way you are.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I fell in love with you for the qualities, abilities, and outlook on life that you have - and won't try to reshape you in a different image.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">I promise to respect you as a person - with your own interests, desires, and needs,  - and to realize that those are sometimes different, but no less important than my own.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">And finally, I promise to love you in good times and in bad,  - with all I have to give and all I feel inside  - in the only way I know how…completely and forever. </span></div>
</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     Ask for the rings.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">Wedding rings are made precious by our wearing them. Let these rings remind you always of the vows you have taken here today.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     To Nick: Repeat after me: "I give you this ring as a symbol of my love for you. Let it be a reminder that I am always by your side and that I will always be a faithful partner to you.”</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     To Nikki: Repeat after me: "I give you this ring as a symbol of my love for you. Let it be a reminder that I am always by your side and that I will always be a faithful partner to you.”</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     By the authority vested in me by the State of Washington, I pronounce you husband and wife.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     You may now kiss the bride.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     Nick and Nikki turn to face the audience:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br/></span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 24px;">     “It is my pleasure and honor to be the first to introduce Mr. and Mrs. Moeur"</span></div>
